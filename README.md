# gosdk
gosdk is a CS:GO SDK that is currently in development, written in C++17 standard, that empowers users to write CS:GO cheats.

# licensing
gosdk is licensed under the GNU v3 license, and according to that, I, Cristei Gabriel-Marian, provide you the code as-is, and give you full freedom over the usage of it, but I will not take responsability for your usage of it. Please consider consulting the actual licensing terms by clicking on the "GPL v3.0" button that should be next to the contributors tab.

# information
The formatting method for gosdk is Clang Format, using the Linux Kernel config. Include Guards are handled by using globals for every filter.

# contribution guidelines
To contribute to gosdk, you need to always adapt your code to the clang format, by re-pasting it into the code file (if you're using Visual Studio, as it's supported by default, if you use any other, you'll be required to either install software that handles it if you don't already have the capability of using the 'clang-format' command in your terminal), and you are also required to specify if your addition was ran through tests to notice if there's any crash occouring due to it. This applies to every commit you plan on doing that it's dirrectly related to the source code.

# features
gosdk currently comes with the IConsole interface, ISurface interface, IInputSystem interface, IPanel interface, IBaseClientDLL for Client interface, ClientMode interface, IEngineClient interface, IEntityList interface, IGlobalVars interface, IDebugOverlay interface, a basic Surface wrapper, a Netvar scanner, a VMT hooking class, sv_cheats bypass (hooked), grenade trajectory (convar, hooked), lock cursor [currently while Insert is hold] (hooked), paint traverse [hooked], create move [hooked], ability to do basic rendering, a console with logging, basic error handling, math utilities, various easing functions and utilities which include a color handler and a config system, memory functions, bunny hop and no duck delay through bitflag easing, Box ESP and Snaplines ESP. These are not final and are to be updated.

Besides the cheating functions, gosdk comes with compability for every IDE, based on the secondary way of project solution generation, by adding a ready-to-use CMake config to the repository. If you use the CMake solution method, you can delete any VS generated file in favor of those provided, or if you use the VS solution method, you can just delete the CMake related ones.

# why should I use this?
gosdk is aimed towards every developer by being very intuitive and trying to reach the best performance in a compact codebase. Besides performance, gosdk has very fast compilation times because it is built to revolve around header usage.

# credits
Credits for gosdk go to places where I take inspiration from, and that would be:
- @DucaRii for csgo_modest [his project helped me with the math utilities].
- @ReigN [unknowncheats.me] for their SDK that I have got the VMT Hooking class from, which was a total time saver, despite some nitpickable issues that are not occouring within this project.
- A few UnknownCheats users for functions that were already posted there to make my life easier.
- Every supposive contributor.
